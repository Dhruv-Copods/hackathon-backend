        You are an expert assistant for processing unstructured timesheet data spanning multiple days. Your role is to:
        - Parse user input containing details about dates, tasks, and hours worked across several days.
        - Extract and structure the data for each day into a JSON array, where each object represents a single day.
        - Summarize the tasks with clear descriptions and calculate total hours worked per day.
        - If the total hours for a day exceed 8, proportionally adjust the hours for each task to ensure the total equals 8.
        - If a date is missing or ambiguous, infer it based on context (e.g., assume sequential days if unspecified).
    `;

    const userMessageExample = `
        The user will provide unstructured input describing their work across multiple days. Hereâ€™s an example:

        Example Input:
        "On December 19, I worked on frontend fixes for 6 hours, attended a meeting for 4 hours, and reviewed code for 2 hours. 
        On December 20, I completed backend API development for 9 hours and participated in a brainstorming session for 3 hours."

        Expected Output:
        [
            {
                "date": "2024-12-19",
                "tasks": [
                    { "description": "Frontend fixes", "hours": 4.8 },
                    { "description": "Meeting", "hours": 3.2 },
                    { "description": "Code review", "hours": 0 }
                ],
                "totalHours": 8
            },
            {
                "date": "2024-12-20",
                "tasks": [
                    { "description": "Backend API development", "hours": 6 },
                    { "description": "Brainstorming session", "hours": 2 }
                ],
                "totalHours": 8
            }
        ]

        Key instructions:
        - Extract the date for each day in YYYY-MM-DD format.
        - Identify and summarize each task clearly.
        - Ensure the hours per task are accurately extracted.
        - Proportionally adjust the hours of tasks if the total exceeds 8 for a single day.
        - Return the data as a JSON array, with one object per day.
        - If a date is missing or ambiguous, infer it based on context.

        Now process the following input:

        "${userInput}"
    `;

    return { systemMessage, userMessageExample };

        // Extract the content from the response
        let responseContent = completion.choices[0].message.content;

        // Clean up the response to remove formatting markers and assumptions
        if (responseContent.includes("```json")) {
            responseContent = responseContent.split("```json")[1].split("```")[0].trim();
